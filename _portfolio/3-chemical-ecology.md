My PhD work explores the chemical ecology of economically important insect pests in forage seed systems. The goal is to identify semiochemicals involved in host-location and foraging behavior.

Ongoing work includes:

- headspace volatile collection from plant tissues and conspecifics 
- GC-MS compound identification  
- GC-EAD electrophysiology to identify active compounds  
- behavioral assays with Y-tube olfactometers  
- evaluation of attract-and-monitor or attract-and-disrupt strategies  

This research supports the development of **pheromone-based or semiochemical-based tools** that reduce reliance on broad-spectrum insecticides.
