excerpt: "How drought and soil microbial communities shape bumblebee foraging behaviour and colony performance in red clover."
---

This project investigates how drought stress and soil microbial communities influence the foraging behaviour and colony-level responses of the common eastern bumblebee (*Bombus impatiens*) in red clover (*Trifolium pratense*).

Using greenhouse-based two-choice and no-choice assays, I measure:

- foraging preference across soil moisture and soil microbiome treatments  
- colony growth, worker production, and hive mass gain  
- treatment effects on nectar volume, sugar concentration, and floral abundance  

The goal is to understand how environmental stressors and soil ecology shape pollination services in red clover seed production systems.
