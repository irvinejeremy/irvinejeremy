## Insect pests of forage seed systems

My core research focuses on insect pests of forage seed crops, particularly red clover (*Trifolium pratense*). I work closely with growers and agronomists to understand pest pressure, yield loss, and realistic management options in northern agricultural systems.

## Lesser clover leaf weevil (*Hypera nigrirostris*)

I study the biology, ecology, and management of the lesser clover leaf weevil in red clover seed production. This work includes:

- Estimating economic injury levels and economic thresholds  
- Developing and evaluating sampling plans  
- Exploring spatial patterns of larval distribution in fields  
- Integrating these results into practical decision-making tools for growers  

## Temperature-dependent development and climate change

Using controlled temperature experiments, I examine how different life stages of key pest species develop and survive across realistic and extreme temperature regimes. These data help to:

- Improve phenology and risk forecasting  
- Inform management timing  
- Anticipate how climate change may alter pest pressure in northern regions  

## Chemical ecology and behavior

My PhD research explores the role of semiochemicals in foraging and host-finding by insect pests in forage seed systems. By identifying and testing behaviorally active compounds, I aim to support the development of pheromone-based tools that can reduce insecticide use while protecting beneficial insects.

## Teaching, training, and student pathways

Alongside my field and lab work, I am interested in how undergraduate research experiences and student societies support the development of future scientists. I am involved in mentoring, teaching, and student leadership that connects entomology, agriculture, and inclusive scientific communities.
